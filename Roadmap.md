# Roadmap

A living, prioritized backlog for Habit Assistant. This is not a spec — it's a queue of what to build next, ordered top-to-bottom by priority (top = highest).

**How this file is maintained:**
- Referenced by name in conversation ("let's do the next roadmap item," "tackle the categories one") instead of being re-described each session — read this file for the actual requirements before starting work.
- Once a feature is implemented, tested, and committed, remove its entry. The commit history is the permanent record; this file only tracks *unbuilt* work.
- Priorities can change on request — reorder by moving the entry to its new position in the list. No two entries share a *position*; position in the list is the priority rank.
- New items can be inserted anywhere in the order on request, including between two existing entries.
- Each entry also carries a **Now / Next / Later** tag — a visual/query layer on top of the ordering, not a replacement for it. A Later item never outranks a Next item, and a Next item never outranks a Now item: all Now entries stay above all Next entries, which stay above all Later entries. Ordering *within* a tier is still just top-to-bottom position, same as before.
- **Item numbers are permanent IDs, written as `§N` — never `#N`.** `#N` auto-links to GitHub issue/PR number N in commit messages, and this repo already had real collisions (roadmap items reused the same digit as unrelated GitHub issues after renumbering, polluting their timelines — fixed 2026-08-20). An ID is assigned once, when an item is first added, and is **never reused**, even after that item is completed and removed — so position (priority rank) and ID are independent: an item's position can change freely, but its `§N` never does. IDs `§1`–`§3` are already retired to historical, now-removed entries (see commits `ff9eaf1`/`2b5bdac` for §1, `d5254af` for §2, `bc8446c`/`c640cae` for §3) — don't reuse them even though they don't appear below.
- **The commit(s) that close an item are the permanent record once its entry is removed here, so they must carry the ID and a real description** — not just `§N` on its own. Convention (settled by practice, e.g. `Close §26: add Cloudflare Workers AI as a third-tier, last-resort fallback` / `Merge §26: add Cloudflare Workers AI as a third-tier, last-resort fallback`): the commit implementing the item and the commit merging it to `main` are both titled `Close §N: <short description>` / `Merge §N: <short description>`, using the same description both times. Commits that aren't closing a specific numbered item (bug fixes found in passing, doc-only edits, mid-item registration/retagging commits) don't need a `§N` prefix.
- **Next available ID: §82** (§62, "today" as the local date rather than UTC, was used directly for §61 Phase 2 — see `Close §62`) (§30 used directly — see `Close §30`/`Merge §30` commits syncing BYOK settings across devices via the Drive data file — without a queued entry here, since it was implemented in the same session it was requested)

### §45 — Voice: slide-to-lock recording (trial on a branch)
Today the mic button must be held for the whole message. Slide-to-lock (as in WhatsApp): while holding, slide the finger to a lock icon, then talk hands-free and tap to send (or cancel). Makes longer voice messages comfortable. UI-only; the transcription pipeline is unchanged.

**Trial first:** build it on a branch for hands-on testing; adopting it isn't decided. If it's dropped, record that and remove the entry.

### §46 — Voice: on-device Whisper (trial on a branch)
Transcribe in the browser (Whisper via WASM/WebGPU) instead of sending audio to Groq: better privacy, works offline, no STT key needed. Costs to measure: model download size (tens to hundreds of MB, precached by the service worker like `public/ort/`), transcription speed on a mid-range Android phone, battery, and accuracy versus Groq Whisper. The Silero VAD silence guard stays in front of it either way.

**Trial first:** a spike on a branch, measured on the user's real phone; adopting it isn't decided. If it's adopted, it's probably a Settings toggle alongside the Groq path rather than a replacement.

### §79 — Export button in the app
An Export button with a period picker (on the stats tab or in Settings), for users who'd rather tap than ask. §72 built the export by chat only ("export my October", with a Download button in the reply); this would reuse its file (`buildExportCsv` in `src/lib/exportCsv.ts`). A small form, which the app otherwise avoids, so only if people ask for it.

### §60 — Extra priority inside a part of the day
§54 replaced the priority number with six parts of the day; inside a part the order is important items first, then A–Z. The user expects that to be enough for their own lists, but another user's part could get cluttered. Only pick this up if that shows in real use.

- Ideas, not decisions: an exact order the user sets ("put reading before meditation", or drag to reorder), or more than one level of importance.
- Whatever is chosen has to stay sayable in chat and readable without numbers, which is what §54 removed.

### §81 — Goals across a category
A goal over a whole category rather than one item: "work out 50 times this quarter" across Sports. §71 hangs every goal on one habit or recurring task; this would count the done days (or amounts, where units agree) of every item in the category. Open questions: what counts when items have different units, and whether items added to the category later join the goal.

New items go in on request, at whichever position and tier they deserve, taking the next free ID above.
