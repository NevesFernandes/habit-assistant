# Roadmap

A living, prioritized backlog for Habit Assistant. This is not a spec — it's a queue of what to build next, ordered top-to-bottom by priority (top = highest).

**How this file is maintained:**
- Referenced by name in conversation ("let's do the next roadmap item," "tackle the categories one") instead of being re-described each session — read this file for the actual requirements before starting work.
- Once a feature is implemented, tested, and committed, remove its entry. The commit history is the permanent record; this file only tracks *unbuilt* work.
- Priorities can change on request — reorder by moving the entry to its new position in the list. No two entries share a *position*; position in the list is the priority rank.
- New items can be inserted anywhere in the order on request, including between two existing entries.
- Each entry also carries a **Now / Next / Later** tag — a visual/query layer on top of the ordering, not a replacement for it. A Later item never outranks a Next item, and a Next item never outranks a Now item: all Now entries stay above all Next entries, which stay above all Later entries. Ordering *within* a tier is still just top-to-bottom position, same as before.
- **Item numbers are permanent IDs, written as `§N` — never `#N`.** `#N` auto-links to GitHub issue/PR number N in commit messages, and this repo already had real collisions (roadmap items reused the same digit as unrelated GitHub issues after renumbering, polluting their timelines — fixed 2026-08-20). An ID is assigned once, when an item is first added, and is **never reused**, even after that item is completed and removed — so position (priority rank) and ID are independent: an item's position can change freely, but its `§N` never does. IDs `§1`–`§3` are already retired to historical, now-removed entries (see commits `ff9eaf1`/`2b5bdac` for §1, `d5254af` for §2, `bc8446c`/`c640cae` for §3) — don't reuse them even though they don't appear below.
- **The commit(s) that close an item are the permanent record once its entry is removed here, so they must carry the ID and a real description** — not just `§N` on its own. Convention (settled by practice, e.g. `Close §26: add Cloudflare Workers AI as a third-tier, last-resort fallback` / `Merge §26: add Cloudflare Workers AI as a third-tier, last-resort fallback`): the commit implementing the item and the commit merging it to `main` are both titled `Close §N: <short description>` / `Merge §N: <short description>`, using the same description both times. Commits that aren't closing a specific numbered item (bug fixes found in passing, doc-only edits, mid-item registration/retagging commits) don't need a `§N` prefix.
- **Next available ID: §48** (§30 used directly — see `Close §30`/`Merge §30` commits syncing BYOK settings across devices via the Drive data file — without a queued entry here, since it was implemented in the same session it was requested)

### §47 — Keep an API key on this device only
Today every BYOK key syncs to the Drive data file in plain text (§30), so each device can use it. That's fine for a free key, but a key with billing (always the case for Anthropic) is only as safe as the Drive file: anyone the folder is shared with, or any app with whole-Drive access, can read it. §40 documented this in the privacy policy (`privacy.html#keys`), in Settings and in `api-key-setup.html`. This item adds the real fix: a per-key **"Keep on this device only"** option in Settings.

- A device-only key stays in `localStorage` and is left out of `exportByokState()`, so it never reaches the Drive file. Other devices don't see it and need their own.
- Sign-in reconciliation (`importByokState` in `App.tsx`) must not overwrite or delete a device-only key with the Drive copy (or its absence).
- Turning the option on for a key that was already synced removes it from the Drive file. **But Google Drive keeps earlier versions of a file (typically for 30 days)**, so the key stays readable in the file's version history. The Settings text should say so, and suggest replacing the key at the provider to be fully safe.
- Update CLAUDE.md's BYOK paragraph, `help.html`, `privacy.html` and `api-key-setup.html` to match.

### §44 — Research: reminders / push notifications
The app is deliberately pull-based today (no notifications). Reminders are the most common habit-app feature, but real push needs something the app doesn't have: a scheduled server-side job that knows when each user's items are due and holds their push subscriptions. That cuts against "data in your own Drive, $0 by construction."

**This item is research only, not a build:** find the cheapest honest design (e.g. Cloudflare Worker cron triggers + Web Push, with the minimum of per-user state held server-side), what it would cost and what data would have to leave Drive, and how well PWA push works on Android. Then decide whether to build it. Until then, keep the CLAUDE.md rule: don't build toward notifications, but don't make them hard to add.

### §45 — Voice: slide-to-lock recording (trial on a branch)
Today the mic button must be held for the whole message. Slide-to-lock (as in WhatsApp): while holding, slide the finger to a lock icon, then talk hands-free and tap to send (or cancel). Makes longer voice messages comfortable. UI-only; the transcription pipeline is unchanged.

**Trial first:** build it on a branch for hands-on testing; adopting it isn't decided. If it's dropped, record that and remove the entry.

### §46 — Voice: on-device Whisper (trial on a branch)
Transcribe in the browser (Whisper via WASM/WebGPU) instead of sending audio to Groq: better privacy, works offline, no STT key needed. Costs to measure: model download size (tens to hundreds of MB, precached by the service worker like `public/ort/`), transcription speed on a mid-range Android phone, battery, and accuracy versus Groq Whisper. The Silero VAD silence guard stays in front of it either way.

**Trial first:** a spike on a branch, measured on the user's real phone; adopting it isn't decided. If it's adopted, it's probably a Settings toggle alongside the Groq path rather than a replacement.

New items go in on request, at whichever position and tier they deserve, taking the next free ID above.
